## What is VexTab?

VexTab is a language that allows you to easily create, edit, and share music notation
and guitar tablature. Unlike ASCII tab, which is designed for readability, VexTab is
designed for writeability.

Go try it out at [The VexTab Tutorial](http://vexflow.com/vextab/tutorial.html).

If you want to save and share your VexTab, try out [My Vexflow](http://my.vexflow.com).

## Updates

VexTab 2.0 now supports all VexTab 1.0 features, and [includes a few new ones](http://my.vexflow.com/articles/53?source=enabled).

## Dependencies

This rewrite of VexTab has three key dependencies:

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) - A *nicer* JavaScript.
  * [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/) - An LALR(1) parser modeled on Bison.
  * [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) - A utility-belt library for JavaScript.

For the audio player feature, you need:

  * [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) - A soundfont renderer for the web.
  * Soundfonts for various instruments - See MIDI.js for more information.

## Prerequisites (for VexTab developers)

First install Node:

    $ brew install node (on OSX)
    $ sudo apt-get install node (on Linux)

Then install the depdencies managed in the `package.json`:

    $ npm install
